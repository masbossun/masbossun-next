This is my journey on learning swift and iOS development. I decide to write my learning here as a second brain, also to keep my learning consistent.

Today i learnt some basic of swift programming language from [Apple Developer Site](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and familiarize with swift syntaxes from [learn x in y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/swift/). Since i'm currently working on windows pc today, so i'm practicing to code with REPL tools online using [replit](https://replit.com/). I found that `struct` in swift are really interesting, and maybe i'll continue to learn and practicing more about it next time.
